    title: "Sign Language Recognition",
    des: "Developed a real time sign language detection LSTM model by fine tuning mediapipeâ€™s holistic model and saving the detected key points as numpy arrays to be used for training and testing. The solution also leveraged OpenCV for computer vision. As a POC, the model can detect 6 sign language expressions as of now, and can be scaled to detect a larger set of expressions.",
